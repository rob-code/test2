<div class="display-6 section-title">1. COOKIES</div>

<p class="display-6 policy-title">WHAT ARE COOKIES?</p>

<p class="policy-text">Cookies are small pieces of data, stored in text files, that are stored on your computer or other device when websites are loaded in a browser. They are widely used to “remember” you and your preferences, either for a single visit (through a “session cookie”) or for multiple repeat visits (using a “persistent cookie”). Cookies may be set by the site that you are visiting (known as “first party cookies”), or by third parties, such as those who serve content or provide advertising or analytics services on the website (“third party cookies”).</p>

<p class="display-6 policy-title">HOW WE USE COOKIES</p>

<p class="policy-text">Analytics. Google Analytics leave cookies on your browser to gather information that helps us understand how visitors interact with our website including what pages are visited most. This allows us to create a better experience for our visitors. Our users may also implement Google Analytics on their own websites.</p>

<p class="policy-text">Third Party Embedded Content. We make use of third party applications and services to enhance the experience of website visitors. These include social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Google+ through the use of link buttons, and embedded content from Youtube and Vimeo. As a result, cookies may be set by these third parties and used by them to track your online activity. We have no direct control over the information that is collected by these cookies and do not have access to that data.</p>

<p class="policy-text">EU Cookie Law Banner. We leave a cookie which remembers the state of visitor acceptance to the EU Cookie Law banner.</p>

<p class="display-6 policy-title">CONTROLLING COOKIES</p>

<p class="policy-text">Visitors may wish to restrict the use of cookies or completely prevent them from being set. Most browsers provide for ways to control cookie behavior such as the length of time they are stored – either through built-in functionality or by utilizing third party plugins. You can, for example, opt out of Google Analytics by installing Google’s opt-out browser add-on.</p>
