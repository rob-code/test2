  question: "What are Giclee prints?",
  answer: "Giclee prints will last up to 75 years and are the best the art world can offer. They are produced using 12 pigment inks which reproduce around 98% of the colour spectrum. They will resist fading even when exposed to sunlight. The paper is archival quality ph neutral 280gsm Natural White Smooth Cotton. Note that the colour of the print may vary slightly from that shown on your monitor. The prints feel wonderful and look great.",

  question: "Are my images made with AI?",
  answer: "No. The images are generated from computer code that I have written. That's the fun and the challenge of doing this work. They are not hand drawn or photographed. AI has not been used in any part of the process. The combinations of colour, shape and so on are generated randomly so I often have to produce many print options before I find one that feels like it sings. The prints you see here are some of my favourites from that process. Every print sold is signed.",
