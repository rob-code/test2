  question: "What are Giclee prints?",
  answer: "Giclee prints will last up to 75 years and are the best the art world can offer. They are produced using 12 pigment inks which reproduce around 98% of the colour spectrum. They will resist fading even when exposed to sunlight. The paper is archival quality ph neutral 280gsm Natural White Smooth Cotton. Note that the colour of the print may vary slightly from that shown on your monitor. The prints feel wonderful and look great.",

  question: "Are the images made with AI?",
  answer: "No. I have written the computer code that has generated this image. It is not drawn or photographed. AI has not been used in any part of the process. The combinations of colour, shape and so on are generated randomly so I often have to produce many print options before I find one that feels like it sings. The print you see here is one of my favourites from that process. Every print is signed.",
