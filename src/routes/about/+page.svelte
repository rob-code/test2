        <p class="lead text-body-secondary item-padding-top">For the last 2 years, I have been developing a practice in digital art. While the landscape of tools and technologies available to the digital artist has never been greater and contiunues to grow, I have focused on learning by creating and developing projects. Some of these projects are shown here on my site. As time goes on and my range increases, I expect what I make will change.</p>
        <p class="lead text-body-secondary">So far I have developed projects in javascript, java, C++ and Blender. I am currently learning vvvv.</p>
        <p class="lead text-body-secondary">I have degrees in physics, environmental management and education, and have enjoyed careers as a renewable energy technologist and as a physics teacher. Alongside these day jobs I have always pursued interests in music, art and sailing. The door into digital art opened when I realised I could combine my interests in art and technology in one practice.</p>
